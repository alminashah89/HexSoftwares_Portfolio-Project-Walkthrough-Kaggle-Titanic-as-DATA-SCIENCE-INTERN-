🚀 Portfolio Project 1 – Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction

Last week, as part of my internship as a Data Science Intern, I worked on building a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. This project helped me gain hands-on experience in:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

Feature Engineering (creating FamilySize and Title features)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations like survival by Pclass, Sex, and Age

Machine Learning Modeling using Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance

This project strengthened my Python programming skills and my ability to apply data science concepts in real-world datasets.
